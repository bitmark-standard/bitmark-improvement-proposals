# bitmark Improvement Proposals 

A repository of proposals to update the [bitmark standard](https://bitmark-association.org).

Proposal process:
- Create a pull request to create a new bitmark-improvement-proposal based on [example-bip.mediawiki](https://github.com/bitmark-standard/bips/blob/main/example-bip.mediawiki)   
- The bitmark Association will review the PR and merge it in after discussion 
- The bitmark standard will be updated accordingly 


Some tips for getting a proposal approved:
- Stick to the format as presented in the [example proposal](https://github.com/bitmark-standard/bips/blob/main/example-bip.mediawiki) and be explicit about motivations behind the change
- Non-breaking changes are prioritised, breaking changes will need a strong rationale and demonstrate significant value for the vast majority of bitmark use cases
