==Proposed changes==

In BIP 0, the following new properties are proposed:
* isProtected: boolean

==Motivation==

* isProtected: boolean (optional, non-breaking)
To indicate whether the resource is protected. We propose <code>isProtected</code> as opposed to <code>isPasswordProtected</code> or <code>authenticationRequired</code> in order to be technology agnostic.
